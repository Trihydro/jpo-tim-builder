MSG_TravelerInformation Message  (TIM) 

The Traveler Information message is used to send various types of information  (advisory and road sign types) to equipped devices. It makes heavy use of the ITIS encoding system to send well known phrases, but allows limited text for local place names. The supported message types specify several sub-dialects of ITIS phrase patterns to further reduce the number of octets to be sent. The expressed messages are active at a precise start and duration period, which can be specified to a resolution of a minute. The affected local area can be expressed using either a radius system or one of the systems of short defined regions, similar to the way roadway geometry is defined in the MAP messages.

Data Frame: DF_TravelerDataFrame 

Use:  The DF_TravelerDataFrame is used to send a single "message" in a TIM message. The data frame allows sending various advisory and road sign types of information to equipped devices. It uses the ITIS encoding system to send well- known phrases, but allows limited text for local place names. The supported message types specify several sub-dialects of ITIS phrase patterns to further reduce the number of octets to be sent. The expressed messages are active at a precise start and duration period, which can be specified to a resolution of a minute. The affected local area (or set of areas) can be expressed using either a radius system or one of the two systems of short defined regions. This expression is similar to the way roadway geometry is defined in the map fragment messages.  The ability to send this message is controlled by the SSPIndex which links back to the senderâ€™s CERT.
